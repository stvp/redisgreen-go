# redisgreen-go

`redisgreen-go` is a simple RedisGreen API client for Go. Use of this client
library is not currently supported and is provided for reference only.

## Contributing

Pull requests and bug reports are welcomed. However, tests require a local
RedisGreen development environment, which you don't have. You may submit pull
requests without tests and we will write them for you.
